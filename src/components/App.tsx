/**
 * Instructions:
 *
 * GraphQL API playground https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/api
 *
 * 1. Load 5 photos from the 1st Album of User with the name that is in the Title component.
 *    Assume the Title text (name) is dynamic and unknown until App has mounted.
 *    Each photo should be shown with a thumbnail and title. Note: the photos look like
 *    placeholders, that's okâ€”-this is a free testing API.
 * 2. Clicking the button should fetch an additional 7 photos and append them to the grid.
 * 3. Display the current count and total count of photos loaded, e.g. 5 of 50.
 *    fetched photos e.g. 5 of 50 - see Controls component.
 * 4. The button should be disabled while data is loading and once all 50 are loaded.
 * 5. Bonus: Complete tests in App.test.tsx.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - Only modify files within src/components.
 * - When you fetch data, don't over or under fetch.
 * - You can use Google and look up any documentation you'd like.
